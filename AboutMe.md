👋 Hello! I'm Zoe Dimou (as you already had figured out :p) , a survey engineer with a passion for Photogrammetry and all things visual. 
My journey has led me through the exciting realms of AI and visual computing, culminating in a master's degree that fueled my curiosity to explore the fusion of technology and creativity.

📐 My fascination with Photogrammetry drives me to turn images into accurate 3D models, creating virtual realities that bridge the gap between imagination and reality.

🎓 With a master's in AI and visual computing, I have harnessed the power of algorithms to unlock the potential of images. My background equips me with the skills to transform raw data into meaningful insights and captivating visualizations.

💻 When I'm not immersed in pixels and data, you'll find me translating concepts into code. My expertise lies in image processing and 3D modeling, where I convert ideas into tangible digital creations. 

🌐 Feel free to explore my repositories, where code and creativity intertwine. Whether it's enhancing images, sculpting 3D worlds, or delving into the intricacies of AI, I'm here to contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology and imagination.

📫 Let's connect! Feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zoe-dimou-4024451a8/). I'm always open to discussions, collaborations, and sharing insights.
